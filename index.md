Bio
======================


![Bill Trikalinos](/images/bill_trikalinos.png) I first started working on the web dev front on 2010.
It had to do with **PHP + MySQL** doing web-admin related stuff.
I was also writing **HTML, CSS** and it was my first encounter with **Javascript** as i
had to make some interactive plugins with voice recording and facebook API integration.

Then on 2011 i had my first contact with **Ruby** and **Ruby On Rails**. The company i worked for at the time
had a custom built CMS base project which i extended and transformed it building many different sites according to project requirements.
The **RoR** dive was a fascinating one as i experienced first hand the many advantages provided by this fantastic framework.
I was also writing the templates, the **CSS** and of course the **Javascript** that was needed.
I came to a very good understanding of **cross-browser, media-queried CSS** on that position.

After that, on the end of 2011, i started my focus on **Javascript**. I was fascinated by the interactive nature of what was produced by the code i wrote,
and by how easy it was. The interpreted dynamic nature of the language was also a great appeal, although many could argue about that.
It is a great language to do rapid prototyping, and it has the added bonus of being ubiquitous.

I then started dwelling into **Coffeescript** and loved it for its type-less, read-wow, don't worry about `var` characteristics,
and i have not stopped writing in it ever since.
I worked my way into writing proper **jQuery plugins**, producing the [Selectorablium][1] plugin, as well a templating one.
I also started exploring the filed of library agnostic, cross-browser code, building a widget loading mini-library,
as well as some widgets that consumed the company API.
I rewrote all of the company's existing codebase into **AMD** modularly modular modules [\[1\]][4] and by using **require.js** and its optimizer we build a simple responsive JS loading mechanism.
I then build the very first version of continuous intergation testign platform for the javascript code usign **Testswarm, QUnit, Sinon.js**
and some code i built to help with the asyncronous nature of the testing environment.

Going on forward i took a turn back to plain old javascript which fortunately enough turned into **ES6/7**. I started writing next gen javascript with the help of **Babel** and i started to work with **browserify** to handle the bundling and transformations. All of this while delving into the fantastic world of **backbone.js** and **Marionette**. Finally i landed on **React/Redux** world, and subsequently **JSX**, enjoying the benefits of unidirectional data flow.

My future plans involve exploring **reactive programming**, finally creating some robust solutions on the server with **node.js** and trying to create a write once - deploy everywhere project using **React** and **React Native**.

I have had plenty of projects as a freelancer which led me to use some other tools as well.
Some of them are the **pjax** plugin, the PHP framework **Laravel** and 
the **Cordova**/**Phonegap** platform to create some mobile applications.
For that i also used the **jQuery Mobile** framework as well as a mix of **Framework7** with **Marionette**.

I use **Git** as my version controll software.
